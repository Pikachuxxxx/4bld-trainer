This is a simple web-abb to help me practice 4BLD letter pairs. This has a weird mode where during the memory the App shows me images and I use them to 
map them to letter pairs like say I get shown car images, I remember it as CR and during recall pahse I enter letter pairs as input and get results and time for it.

This is just to learn letter letter pairs from image --> pair style.

I have a JSON file with telugu/f1/pop-culture and other specific refs to remember more easily.
